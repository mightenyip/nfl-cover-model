## Opponent Defense Quality Analysis

### Key Correlation Findings
The analysis reveals the impact of opponent defensive quality on underdog performance:

#### Against WEAK Defenses (3 games):
- **Cover Rate**: 0.0% (0/3)
- **Avg Underdog Offensive EPA**: +0.124
- **Avg Underdog Net EPA**: +0.281

#### Against AVERAGE Defenses (10 games):  
- **Cover Rate**: 50.0% (5/10)
- **Avg Underdog Offensive EPA**: -0.015
- **Avg Underdog Net EPA**: -0.064

#### Against STRONG Defenses (3 games):
- **Cover Rate**: 66.7% (2/3)
- **Avg Underdog Offensive EPA**: +0.070
- **Avg Underdog Net EPA**: +0.221

### Strategic Implications
- **Target underdogs facing STRONG defenses** - they had a 66.7% cover rate
- **Avoid underdogs facing WEAK defenses** - they had a 0% cover rate
- **Average defenses provided moderate opportunities** - 50% cover rate
- **The Week 1 finding was partially reversed** - strong defenses still favored underdogs, but weak defenses were completely avoided

## Key Insights

1. **Realistic Underdog Performance**: Week 2 underdogs had a 43.8% cover rate, slightly below the expected 50% baseline but much more realistic than the initial incorrect calculation.

2. **Model Performance Issues**: The model achieved 43.8% accuracy on spread predictions, indicating significant issues with the predictive framework, especially for high-confidence picks.

3. **Confidence Level Paradox**: High confidence picks (0% accuracy) performed worse than low confidence picks (66.7% accuracy), suggesting the model's confidence calibration is problematic.

4. **EPA Correlation Breakdown**: Unlike Week 1, there was minimal correlation between net EPA and cover performance in Week 2, with covered underdogs actually having worse net EPA on average.

5. **Opponent Defense Partial Reversal**: The Week 1 finding that weak defenses favor underdogs was completely reversed - weak defenses led to 0% underdog cover rate, while strong defenses maintained favorability.

6. **Outright Win Success**: 31.2% of underdogs won outright, indicating moderate upset activity in Week 2.

## Spread Distribution Analysis

| Spread Range | Games | Covered | Cover Rate |
|--------------|-------|---------|------------|

| +1.5 | 1 | 1 | 100.0% |
| +2.5 | 2 | 2 | 100.0% |
| +3.0 | 1 | 1 | 100.0% |

## Conclusion

Week 2 2025 results revealed a more realistic underdog performance pattern with a 43.8% cover rate. The model's predictive framework showed significant issues, particularly with high-confidence predictions (0% accuracy). 

The EPA-based approach showed minimal predictive value in Week 2, with covered underdogs actually performing worse on net EPA metrics. The opponent defense quality finding was partially reversed - strong defenses still favored underdogs (66.7% cover rate), but weak defenses completely failed to produce underdog covers (0% cover rate).

**Key Takeaways for Future Analysis:**
- **Model confidence calibration needs improvement** - high confidence picks performed worst
- **EPA metrics showed limited predictive value** in Week 2
- **Opponent defense quality remains important** but with different patterns than Week 1
- **Smaller spreads (+1.5 to +3.0) performed better** than larger spreads
- **Need larger sample size** to establish reliable patterns beyond weekly variance

## Methodology Notes

This analysis was corrected after initial calculation errors. The key corrections made:
1. **Proper home/away team identification** from game strings
2. **Correct score assignments** matching actual NFL results
3. **Accurate cover calculations** based on proper margin analysis
4. **Realistic performance metrics** replacing inflated initial calculations

The methodology follows the same approach used for Week 1 analysis, ensuring consistency across weeks.
