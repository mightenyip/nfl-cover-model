# Data Limitation Correction - Week 2 EPA Analysis

## Issue Identified

The "Week 1+2" EPA analysis was **incorrectly labeled**. Upon investigation, the 2025 play-by-play data file only contains **Week 1 games**, not Week 2.

## What Actually Happened

### Data Source Analysis
- **File**: `images/play_by_play_2025.parquet`
- **Actual Content**: Only Week 1 games (16 games, 2,706 plays)
- **Date Range**: September 4-8, 2025 (Week 1 only)
- **Weeks Available**: [1] only

### Bills Example
- **Our Calculation**: Bills defensive EPA +0.340 (Week 1 only)
- **Online Sources**: Bills defensive EPA 0.06 (likely Week 2 or cumulative)
- **Discrepancy**: Our data is Week 1 only, online sources include Week 2

## Corrected Understanding

### What Our Data Actually Shows
The EPA metrics in `updated_team_epa_after_week2.csv` are actually **Week 1 only**, not Week 1+2 as labeled.

### Bills Week 1 Performance
- **Defensive EPA Allowed**: +0.340 per play (terrible)
- **Game**: Ravens 40 - Bills 41 (Bills won but defense struggled)
- **Context**: This was against the high-powered Ravens offense

### Why Online Sources Differ
Online sources showing Bills defensive EPA of 0.06 likely include:
1. **Week 2 data** (which we don't have)
2. **Cumulative Week 1+2 data** (which we don't have)
3. **Different calculation methods** or data sources

## Implications

### For Week 2 Analysis
- Our Week 2 results analysis is still correct (actual game outcomes)
- But our EPA-based explanations are based on Week 1 data only
- The model's failure in Week 2 may be due to using outdated Week 1 EPA metrics

### For Future Analysis
- Need to obtain actual Week 2 play-by-play data
- EPA metrics will be different after Week 2 games
- Model predictions should use the most recent EPA data available

## Recommendations

1. **Acknowledge the limitation** in all Week 2 analyses
2. **Update file names** to reflect Week 1 data only
3. **Seek Week 2 play-by-play data** from nflverse or other sources
4. **Re-run EPA calculations** once Week 2 data is available
5. **Update model predictions** with correct EPA metrics

## Files That Need Correction

- `updated_team_epa_after_week2.csv` → Should be `team_epa_week1_only.csv`
- `epa_comparison_week1_vs_week2.md` → Should be `epa_analysis_week1_only.md`
- All references to "Week 1+2" should be "Week 1 only"

## Conclusion

The discrepancy between our Bills defensive EPA (+0.340) and online sources (0.06) is due to our data only containing Week 1 games. The Bills likely improved significantly in Week 2, but we don't have that data to confirm.

This limitation explains why the model failed in Week 2 - it was using outdated Week 1 EPA metrics to predict Week 2 outcomes, when teams' performance had already changed.
