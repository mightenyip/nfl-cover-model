# Corrected EPA Analysis - Week 1+2 2025

## Data Correction

**Previous Issue**: Our "Week 1+2" analysis was actually Week 1 data only, causing significant discrepancies.

**Resolution**: Successfully pulled latest data from [nflverse GitHub releases](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp) which now includes both Week 1 and Week 2 games.

## Updated Data Summary

- **Total plays**: 5,527 (vs 2,738 previously)
- **Weeks included**: 1 and 2 (vs 1 only previously)
- **Games**: 32 total (16 per week)
- **Data source**: Latest nflverse release

## Bills EPA Correction

### Previous (Week 1 Only)
- **Defensive EPA allowed**: +0.340 per play
- **Context**: Terrible Week 1 performance vs Ravens

### Corrected (Week 1+2)
- **Defensive EPA allowed**: +0.098 per play
- **Context**: Improved significantly in Week 2
- **Net EPA**: +0.094 per play

This explains the discrepancy with online sources showing ~0.06 defensive EPA - they were using cumulative data through Week 2.

2. **Falcons** - Strong defensive performance in Week 2
3. **Packers** - Consistent performance across both weeks

### Teams Still Struggling

2. **Bears** - Major offensive and defensive issues
3. **Browns** - Offense struggling significantly

### Defensive Standouts (Low EPA Allowed)
1. **Falcons** (-0.132 EPA allowed per play)

## Implications for Model Performance

### Why Week 2 Model Failed
The model used **Week 1 EPA metrics** to predict Week 2 outcomes, but:
- **Bills defense improved** significantly (0.340 â†’ 0.098)
- **Team performance changed** dramatically between weeks
- **EPA rankings shifted** substantially

### Updated Opponent Defense Rankings
**Strong Defenses (Target for underdog picks):**
1. Falcons (-0.132 EPA allowed)
2. Packers (-0.062 EPA allowed)
3. Chargers (-0.063 EPA allowed)

**Weak Defenses (Avoid for underdog picks):**
1. Dolphins (+0.220 EPA allowed)
2. Jets (+0.193 EPA allowed)
3. Bears (+0.124 EPA allowed)

## Conclusion

The corrected data shows that team performance varies significantly between weeks. The Week 2 model failure was largely due to using outdated Week 1 metrics. Future predictions should use the most recent cumulative EPA data available.

**Key Takeaway**: EPA metrics are dynamic and change week-to-week. Models need to be updated with the latest data to maintain accuracy.
