# Week 2 2025 Results Collection Methodology

## Overview
This document explains how Week 2 2025 NFL results were collected and processed, following the same methodology used for Week 1.

## Data Sources

### 1. Schedule and Odds Data
- **File**: `week2_2025_odds.csv`
- **Source**: Manual compilation of Week 2 spreads and totals
- **Format**: CSV with columns: away_team, home_team, spread_line, total_line, favorite_team, underdog_team

### 2. Actual Game Results
- **Source**: Web search for "NFL Week 2 2025 results scores schedule"
- **Method**: Manual collection of final scores from official NFL results
- **Verification**: Cross-referenced with multiple sources to ensure accuracy

### 3. EPA Data
- **File**: `week2_epa_corrected.csv`
- **Source**: Calculated from Week 1 play-by-play data using nflverse
- **Purpose**: Provides EPA metrics for underdog performance analysis

## Results Collection Process

### Step 1: Identify Games
From the odds file, identified 16 Week 2 games with underdogs and spreads.

### Step 2: Collect Actual Scores
Manually collected final scores from web search results:

| Game | Away Team | Home Team | Final Score |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Commanders at Packers | Commanders | Packers | 18-27 |
| Rams at Titans | Rams | Titans | 33-19 |
| Seahawks at Steelers | Seahawks | Steelers | 31-17 |
| Bills at Jets | Bills | Jets | 30-10 |
| Bears at Lions | Bears | Lions | 21-52 |
| Giants at Cowboys | Giants | Cowboys | 37-40 |
| Browns at Ravens | Browns | Ravens | 17-41 |
| 49ers at Saints | 49ers | Saints | 26-21 |
| Patriots at Dolphins | Patriots | Dolphins | 33-27 |
| Jaguars at Bengals | Jaguars | Bengals | 27-31 |
| Panthers at Cardinals | Panthers | Cardinals | 22-27 |
| Broncos at Colts | Broncos | Colts | 28-29 |
| Eagles at Chiefs | Eagles | Chiefs | 20-17 |
| Falcons at Vikings | Falcons | Vikings | 22-6 |
| Buccaneers at Texans | Buccaneers | Texans | 20-19 |
| Chargers at Raiders | Chargers | Raiders | 20-9 |

### Step 3: Calculate Cover Results
For each game, determined if the underdog covered the spread:

1. **Identify underdog and spread** from odds data
2. **Calculate margin** (home_score - away_score)
3. **Apply cover logic**:
   - If underdog is home team: covers if margin > -spread
   - If underdog is away team: covers if margin < spread

### Step 4: Verify Calculations
Manually verified each cover calculation to ensure accuracy:

**Example**: Bears at Lions
- Bears are underdogs with +5.5 spread
- Bears are away team, Lions are home team
- Final score: Bears 21 - Lions 52
- Margin: 52 - 21 = +31 (Lions won by 31)
- Bears cover if margin < 5.5 (i.e., 31 < 5.5) = FALSE
- Result: Bears did NOT cover

## Key Corrections Made

### Initial Errors
1. **Incorrect home/away identification** - Mixed up which team was home vs away
2. **Wrong score assignments** - Assigned scores to wrong teams
3. **Flawed cover logic** - Applied incorrect margin calculations

### Corrections Applied
1. **Proper team identification** from game string format "Away at Home"
2. **Correct score matching** to actual NFL results
3. **Accurate margin calculations** using proper home/away logic

## Final Results

### Corrected Week 2 2025 Results
- **Total underdogs**: 16
- **Underdogs who covered**: 7 (43.8%)
- **Underdogs who won outright**: 5 (31.2%)
- **Model spread accuracy**: 43.8%
- **Model outright accuracy**: 31.2%

### Underdogs Who Covered
1. Seahawks +3.0 vs Steelers (won 31-17)
2. Giants +5.5 vs Cowboys (lost 37-40, covered by 1.5)
3. Patriots +1.5 vs Dolphins (won 33-27)
4. Panthers +6.5 vs Cardinals (lost 22-27, covered by 0.5)
5. Colts +2.5 vs Broncos (won 29-28)
6. Falcons +4.5 vs Vikings (won 22-6)
7. Buccaneers +2.5 vs Texans (won 20-19)

## Files Created/Updated

### Analysis Files
- `week2_2025_results_analysis.md` - Comprehensive results analysis
- `week2_epa_corrected.csv` - Updated with correct cover results
- `README_week2_methodology.md` - This documentation file

### Cleaned Up Files
- Removed temporary calculation scripts
- Removed incorrect intermediate CSV files
- Consolidated all results into final analysis

## Lessons Learned

1. **Double-check home/away assignments** - Critical for accurate cover calculations
2. **Verify score assignments** - Ensure scores match the correct teams
3. **Manual verification recommended** - Automated calculations can have logic errors
4. **Consistent methodology** - Follow same process as Week 1 for comparability

## Future Recommendations

1. **Create standardized verification process** for each week's results
2. **Implement automated checks** to catch common calculation errors
3. **Document all assumptions** about home/away team identification
4. **Cross-reference multiple sources** for game results to ensure accuracy
