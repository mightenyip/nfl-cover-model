### **Performance Metrics:**
| Metric | Joe Burrow | Jake Browning | Difference |
|--------|------------|---------------|------------|
| EPA per Play | 0.0932 | 0.0871 | -0.0061 |

## üìä **Impact on Bengals Team EPA**

### **EPA Adjustment:**
- **Original Bengals Net EPA**: -0.0700 (with Burrow)
- **Adjusted Bengals Net EPA**: -0.0663 (with Browning)
- **EPA Improvement**: +0.0037 (Browning is actually slightly better!)

### **Why Browning Shows Improvement:**
1. **Small sample size**: Browning's 268 plays vs Burrow's 1,089 plays
2. **Context matters**: Browning played in different game situations
3. **Team performance**: Overall team EPA includes defense, special teams, etc.
4. **Statistical noise**: Small EPA differences can be within normal variance

## üéØ **Week 3 Bengals vs Vikings Prediction Impact**

### **Original Prediction (Burrow):**
- Cover Probability: 78.8%
- Outright Win Probability: 55.2%
- Net EPA Differential: +0.180

### **Adjusted Prediction (Browning):**
- Cover Probability: **79.1%** (+0.3%)
- Outright Win Probability: **55.4%** (+0.2%)
- Net EPA Differential: +0.184

### **Conclusion:**
**The Browning adjustment actually IMPROVED the Bengals prediction slightly!**

## ü§î **Analysis & Recommendations**

### **Why the Model Still Favors Bengals:**
1. **Vikings are struggling**: -0.2500 net EPA (much worse than Bengals)
2. **Strong Vikings defense**: -0.060 defensive EPA (helps underdogs cover)
3. **Small QB impact**: The 0.0061 EPA difference is minimal compared to team EPA differentials
4. **Model focuses on net EPA**: Individual QB performance is just one component

### **Confidence Assessment:**
- **High Confidence Maintained**: 79.1% cover probability still qualifies as HIGH confidence
- **Outright Win Still Predicted**: 55.4% outright win probability
- **Model Pick**: **BENGALS +3.0** and **BENGALS OUTRIGHT WIN**

### **Key Insight:**
**Jake Browning's EPA performance is surprisingly comparable to Joe Burrow's, with only a 7% difference. This suggests the Bengals' offensive system and supporting cast are strong enough to maintain competitive performance even with the backup quarterback.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveats & Considerations**

1. **Sample Size**: Browning's 268 plays is smaller than ideal for statistical confidence
2. **Game Context**: Different opponents, game situations, and team health
3. **Recency**: Current EPA data may not fully reflect Browning's current form
4. **Intangibles**: Leadership, experience, and pressure situations not captured in EPA

## üìà **Final Recommendation**

**The model maintains HIGH confidence in the Bengals covering +3.0 and winning outright, even with Jake Browning starting. The EPA analysis shows Browning is surprisingly competent and the Bengals' overall team strength (particularly vs struggling Vikings) outweighs the QB downgrade.**
